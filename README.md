## Tips

- **Stream vs Local**: Streams work instantly but require internet. Local files work offline and use your own music collection.
- **Pomodoro Technique**: The default 25:5 ratio is scientifically proven to maintain focus while preventing burnout.
- **Volume**: Start at 30% and adjust to your preference - especially important with headphones!
- **Animation**: Try it out! Some users find it calming, others prefer it off for less distraction.

## Troubleshooting

**No audio playing?**
- Check if an audio source is selected in settings
- For streams: Verify internet connection
- For local files: Ensure folder contains MP3 files

**Can't see playback controls?**
- Playback controls appear in the status bar (bottom of Obsidian)
- For streams: Only play/pause button shows (no prev/next)
- For local files: All controls show (prev/play/next)

**Timer not starting?**
- Click the play button (▶) next to the timer display
- Check timer durations are set to positive numbers in settings
